# LZW Compression Project

This project demonstrates the LZW compression algorithm. Below are the instructions to compile and run the `main.cpp` and `test.cpp` files.

## Running `main.cpp`

To compile and run `main.cpp`, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
g++ main.cpp LZW_compress.cpp -o main
main
```

## Running `test.cpp`

To compile and run `test.cpp`, use the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
g++ test.cpp LZW_compress.cpp -o test
test
```

Make sure you have `g++` installed on your system to compile the C++ files.
